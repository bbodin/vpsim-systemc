// Dijkstra's Algorithm ( Simple C++ Implementation)
// -------------------------------------------------
// Dijkstra's algorithm is simply BFS + priority queue and includes a relaxation step.
// For details please refer to Introduction to algorithm by Cormen.
// Complete c++ code with a test code is given below.

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

namespace vpsim {
    //!
//! graph structure used for the dijkstra algorithm
//! it is a vector with the length of all Node length, of vectors representing all out edges of each node
//! an edge being represented as a pair (successor node , distance to node)
//!
    typedef vector<vector<pair<int, float> > > Graph;

    //!
//! Class used as functor to provide comparison used in STL sorting
//!
    class Comparator {
    public:
        //!
	//! Distance comparison operator between second element element of pair
	//! @param [in] p1 : a pair (int,float) whose second element will be used for comparison with p2
	//! @param [in] p2 : a pair (int,float) whose second element will be used for comparison with p1
	//! @return true if p1.second>p2.second and false otherwise
	//!
        int operator()(const pair<int, float> &p1, const pair<int, float> &p2);

//! Disjktra shortest path algorithm
//! @param [in] G : A representation of a graph as Graph
//! @param [in] source : a source node whose shortest path to destination node is searched
//! @param [in] destination : a destination node
//! @param [in,out] path : as input an empty vector, as output a vector of successive node IDs representing the shortest path from @param source to @param destination
